    <p><b>Rome</b></p>
    <p>Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Once the capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies and polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of the Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic and intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City, remaining today a political capital, a religious centre, and a memorial to the greatest achievements of the past.
    <p><b>Nairobi</b></p>
    <p> the bustling capital of Kenya, offers a unique blend of city life and wildlife experiences. It is the only city in the world with a national park, Nairobi National Park, where visitors can spot lions, rhinos, and giraffes against the backdrop of the city skyline. The city is also home to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, famous for its elephant orphanage, and the Giraffe Centre, where tourists can interact with endangered Rothschild giraffes. For a dose of culture and history, the Karen Blixen Museum and Bomas of Kenya showcase colonial heritage and traditional Kenyan life</p>
